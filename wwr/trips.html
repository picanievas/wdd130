            Citrus Oaks
            <p>See and experience all 8 miles of the Citrus Oaks river as it winds through the one of a kind
              biodiversity in the Texas Hill Country. Citrus Oaks river will be led by an expert guide that can give you
              information on the flora and fauna you will experience as you adventure down this river. One of the main
              bends on Citrus Oaks leads your raft into some exciting moderate rapids that will bounce and toss your
              raft around a bit so we recommend this trip for groups that have been on a raft before. You will get to
              put your paddling skills to the test as you get the opportunity to be part of nature and the rolling
              rapids. The next exciting part about choosing Citrus Oaks is you will be led by a team member that rides
              this river several times a day so they will give you the best navigation down the river for your crew.</p>

          <figcaption>Splashy Rock
            <p>Your trip down to Splashy Rock begins with a short shuttle ride up to the northeastern side of the
              Takahomi River. This river adventure has lots of big splashes that your whole group can enjoy. The rapids
              are nicely spaced out along the river path; you will get some really large splashes when you do encounter
              them, especially along the river bends that lead you through Splashy Rock. Our guide will navigate you
              down the river so you can experience the thrills and beauty of the river. This trip out on the river will
              give you a true white water rafting adventure. Your group will spend the 7 miles out on the water and in
              the sun enjoying all that nature has to offer. This trip is great for any group that is looking to have a
              real adventure to brag about for years to come.</p>

          <figcaption>Chocolate Lagoon <p>If you are looking for a relaxing recharging river experience we recommend
              Chocolate Lagoon. On this river journey your group will get to spend quality time with nature and enjoy
              the river. This is the more calm of all our river excursions so there tends to be much more wildlife that
              is spotted along the banks. Along your trip you will also get to see how the years of water corrosion have
              shaped the landscape. Your group will take in determined trees that line the cliffs and pepper the
              pristine geologic environment. Chocolate Lagoon will take you through some minor rapids that are great for
              families or groups with younger raft riders. The winding river for this excursion stretches just over 7
              miles. This gives you the chance to make it the experience of a lifetime with all the delights of an
              incredible river rafting adventure.</p>
